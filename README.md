3. Update task: Allows updating the description of an existing task.

4. Remove task: Deletes a task based on its number.

5. Mark task as completed: Marks a specified task as completed.

6. Exit: Ends the program.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language used to implement the code.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Used for creating the Task and ToDoList classes.

CLI (Command Line Interface): Interaction with the program through user input.

Control Flow: Loops and conditionals (while, if-else) for menu navigation.

**Key Insights**
Task Management: Tasks can be added, viewed, updated, marked as completed, or removed.

Status Indicator: Tasks show a '✔' for completed and '✘' for incomplete.

Menu Interface: A user-friendly menu guides interaction with task options.

Validation: Input is validated to ensure correct task numbers are used for updates, completions, and removals.

Loop Control: The program continuously runs until the user chooses to exit.
